## Source plot functions
There are a few variations of the plot available in a few different functions, plus some support functions to tidy data. 
```{r}
source("scripts/generalised_cell_cell_interaction.R")
```

## Load example seurat object
```{r, include=FALSE}
load("data/example_myeloid_seurat.RData")

d10x <- NormalizeData(d10x)
d10x <- FindVariableFeatures(d10x, selection.method = "vst", nfeatures = 2000)
d10x <- ScaleData(d10x) 
d10x <- RunPCA(d10x, ndims.print = 1:10, nfeatures.print = 10)
d10x <- RunUMAP(d10x, dims = 1:30)
head(d10x)

```


## Make a simple cell-cell interaction data structure
This is the more general structure. Cell-cell interactions could be from receptor-ligand interaction predictions, measured surface receptors, whatever!
```{r}
cell_cell_connections<-data.frame(Cell1=c("cDC2","Monocytes","Monocytes"), Cell2=c("cDC1","cDC1","Monocytes"))
cell_cell_connections
```


## Colour UMAP by Cell Type
This function takes arguments as follows: seurat object, column name of cell type, a data.frame structured like "cell_cell_connections". 

Optional arguments: ligand_cell_type - do you want to limit the curves drawn to only starting at one cell type of interest? For example only cDC2 cells
self_interactions - do you want to see loops for when cells are interacting with themselves?
label_cell_type - do you want text labels for the cell types
Defaults: ligand_cell_type = NA, self_interactions = F, label_cell_type = T
```{r}
plot_gene_UMAP_color_bycelltype(d10x, "annotation",cell_cell_connections)
plot_gene_UMAP_color_bycelltype(d10x, "annotation",cell_cell_connections, self_interactions = T)
plot_gene_UMAP_color_bycelltype(d10x, "annotation",cell_cell_connections,ligand_cell_type = "cDC2", label_cell_type=F)
```

## Colour UMAP by expression of two genes
This function takes arguments as follows: seurat object, column name of cell type, a data.frame structured like "cell_cell_connections", receptor gene name, ligand gene name (don't have to be receptor and ligands just a common use case).

Optional arguments: ligand_cell_type - do you want to limit the curves drawn to only starting at one cell type of interest? For example only cDC2 cells
self_interactions - do you want to see loops for when cells are interacting with themselves?
label_cell_type - do you want text labels for the cell types
percentile - the percentile cut off to call a gene as "highly expressed" and color a cell as having that gene "on"
Defaults: ligand_cell_type = NA, self_interactions = F, label_cell_type = T,percentile = 0.8

```{r}
plot_gene_UMAP_exp_colored(d10x,"annotation" ,cell_cell_connections, ligand = "CCL3", receptor="CCR1")
plot_gene_UMAP_exp_colored(d10x,"annotation" ,cell_cell_connections, ligand = "CCL3", receptor="CCR1", percentile = 0.9)
plot_gene_UMAP_exp_colored(d10x,"annotation" ,cell_cell_connections, ligand = "CCL3", receptor="CCR1",ligand_cell_type = "cDC2")
```



## Using cellphonedb output
This code is an example of the function to format cpdb data to structure it like cell-cell connection data.

```{r}
cpdb_output<-read.table("data/example_statistical_analysis_significant_means_03_05_2024_15:06:27.txt", sep="\t", header=T)
cell_cell_connections<-cell_cell_format_cpdb(cpdb_output, receptor="CCR1",ligand="CCL3")
head(cell_cell_connections)

plot_gene_UMAP_exp_colored(d10x,"annotation" ,cell_cell_connections, ligand = "CCL3", receptor="CCR1")
plot_gene_UMAP_exp_colored(d10x,"annotation" ,cell_cell_connections,ligand_cell_type = "pDC",ligand = "CCL3", receptor="CCR1")
```





## Using CellChat output
This code is an example of the function to format CellChat data to structure it like cell-cell connection data.

d10x in this example is a seurat object which the cellchat was run on. "annotation" is the name of the cell label column in that seurat object. 
```{r}
library(CellChat)
load("../../Downloads/cellchat_merged.RData")

df.net <- subsetCommunication(cellchat)
head(df.net$Healthy)

cell_cell_connections<-cell_cell_format_cellchat(df.net$Healthy, receptor="CD8A",ligand="HLA-B")
head(cell_cell_connections)

############# this should be deleted with real data #################
# d10x is the seurat object cellchat was run on
## using a fake seurat object here to match cell names from cell chat
d10x$annotation<-as.factor(d10x$annotation)
levels(d10x$annotation)<-c("CD8T","Paneth", "TuftCells",unique(cellchat@meta$annotation)[1:7])
d10x$annotation<-as.character(d10x$annotation)
#####################################################################

plot_gene_UMAP_exp_colored(d10x,"annotation" ,cell_cell_connections,ligand_cell_type = "CD8T",ligand = "HLA-B", receptor="CD8A")
```
